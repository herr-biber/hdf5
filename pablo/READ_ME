To build the Pablo Instrumented version of the HDF 5 library

1) Configure the system as normal from the parent directory

2) Make the normal HDF 5 library 

3) Edit the make file in this directory:
   - Find the variable PABLO_INC and set it to the path to the include 
     directory for the Pablo TraceLibrary
   - If building to instrument MPI programs, uncomment the line beginning
     PABLO_MPI_FLAGS.  In this case, the Pablo TraceLibrary should be built
     to trace the MPI-I/O calls.
   - Issue the make or make install command
