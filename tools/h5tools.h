     * Fields associated with formatting numeric data.  If a datatype matches
     * multiple formats based on its size, then the first applicable format
     * from this list is used. However, if `raw' is non-zero then dump all
     * data in hexadecimal format without translating from what appears on
     * disk.
     *
     *	 raw:        If set then print all data as hexadecimal without
     *		     performing any conversion from disk.
     *
     *	 fmt_raw:    The printf() format for each byte of raw data. The
     *		     default is `%02x'.
     *
     *	 fmt_int:    The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `int'. The default is `%d'.
     *
     *	 fmt_uint:   The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `unsigned'. The default is `%u'.
     *
     *	 fmt_schar:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `signed char'. The default is `%d'. This format is
     *		     used ony if the `ascii' field is zero.
     *
     *	 fmt_uchar:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `unsigned char'. The default is `%u'. This format
     *		     is used only if the `ascii' field is zero.
     *	 
     *	 fmt_short:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `short'. The default is `%d'.
     *
     *	 fmt_ushort: The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `unsigned short'. The default is `%u'.
     *
     *	 fmt_long:   The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `long'. The default is `%ld'.
     *
     *	 fmt_ulong:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `unsigned long'. The default is `%lu'.
     *
     *	 fmt_llong:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `long long'. The default depends on what printf()
     *		     format is available to print this datatype.
     *
     *	 fmt_ullong: The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `unsigned long long'. The default depends on what
     *		     printf() format is available to print this datatype.
     *
     *	 fmt_double: The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `double'. The default is `%g'.
     * 
     *	 fmt_float:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is
     *		     typed `float'. The default is `%g'.
     *
     *	 ascii:      If set then print 1-byte integer values as an ASCII
     *		     character (no quotes).  If the character is one of the
     *		     standard C escapes then print the escaped version.  If
     *		     the character is unprintable then print a 3-digit octal
     *		     escape.  If `ascii' is zero then then 1-byte integers are
     *		     printed as numeric values.  The default is zero.
     *
     *	 str_locale: Determines how strings are printed. If zero then strings
     *		     are printed like in C except. If set to ESCAPE_HTML then
     *		     strings are printed using HTML encoding where each
     *		     character not in the class [a-zA-Z0-9] is substituted
     *		     with `%XX' where `X' is a hexadecimal digit.
     *
     *	 str_repeat: If set to non-zero then any character value repeated N
     *		     or more times is printed as 'C'*N
     *
     * Numeric data is also subject to the formats for individual elements.

     *		    1:  Print the current element beginning where the
     *			previous element left off. But if that would result
     *			in the element occupying more than one line and it
     *			would only occupy one line if it started at the
     *			beginning of a line, then it is printed at the
     *			beginning of the next line.
     *
     *	 multi_new: If an element is continued onto additional lines then
     *		    should the following element begin on the next line? The
     *		    default is to start the next element on the same line
     *		    unless it wouldn't fit.
