HDF5 Build and Install Instructions for Windows 2000/XP (Full Version)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions assume that the HDF5 source code package from
HDF website (http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu) is used.


***************************WARNINGS*************************************
Please read CAREFULLY about the following preconditions and notes first

Preconditions 

   1. Installed Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or Intel C compiler and WinZip.
       
      1.1 Installed DEC Visual Fortran compiler(6.0 or higher version), 
          or Intel Fortran compiler if you want to build HDF5 Fortran
          libraries.    

      Note: By default, WinZip will convert the Unix end of line format
            when extracting .tar file.  This conversion will cause
            "false" failure in some HDF5 tools testings.
 
            Please uncheck the "TAR file smart CR/LF conversion" option
            in your WinZip to prevent the conversion when extracting
            .tar file.

            To uncheck the "TAR file smart CR/LF conversion" option:

            Invoke WinZip, go to "Options", select "Configuration..."

            Click the "Miscellaneous" tab and uncheck "TAR file smart
            CR/LF conversion" option, then click OK.

   2. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library.  For example:

	        c:\                              (any drive)
	        MyHDFstuff\                      (any folder name)

   3. Download the hdf5-1.6.3 source code package and use WinZip to 
      extract the HDF5 package into c:\MyHDFstuff.  This creates a 
      directory called 'hdf5-1.6.3' under MyHDFstuff which contains 
      several files and directories.  Rename "hdf5-1.6.3" to "hdf5".  

   4. HDF5 provide options to do in-memory compress within HDF5
      library.  Currently, two external compression libraries zlib and
      szlib can be used with HDF5.

      4.1 HDF5 uses zlib version 1.1.4 for compression and zlib is NOT
          distributed with HDF5 lib in 1.6.3 release. To use zlib 
          library, you have to install your own zlib library or go to
          HDF web site
          (ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/gzip/bin/windows/zlib114/) 
          to download the zlib library.
      
      4.2 HDF5 uses szlib(szip) for compression and szlib is 
          distributed with HDF5 lib starting from 1.6.2 binary
          release.  You can also download szlib source codes and 
          binaries from ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/szip/bin/windows.
          Please note that szip is not a totally open-source free
          software.  For licensing issue of szip, please check 
          "Licensing terms" at
          http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/index.html.

      Compression feature inside HDF5 is optional. 
      
   5. Define the following environment variables: 

        HDF5_EXT_ZLIB
        HDF5_EXT_SZIP
        HDF5_SZIP_ENCODE
        HDF5_EXT_ZLIB_DLL
        HDF5_EXT_SZIP_DLL
      
      In this section, zlib and szip are assumed to be used.  Please 
      read section V as well as this section if you do not want to use
      compression feature inside HDF5.
      
      To define these environment variables:
      
      Click "Start", click "Control Panel", and then double-click
      "System".  On the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables".
      
      If you are logged on as administrator to the local computer AND
      want to let all other users use these two environment variables,
      click "New" under "System Variables" box; otherwise, click "New"
      under "User Variables" box.
      
      In the New Variable window, set Variable name as HDF5_EXT_ZLIB
      and Variable value as zlib.lib, then click OK.
      
      Similarly, you can set:

      HDF5_EXT_SZIP environment variable as szlib.lib
      HDF5_SZIP_ENCODE environment variable as 1
      HDF5_EXT_ZLIB_DLL environment variable as c:\zlib114\dll\zlib.lib
      HDF5_EXT_SZIP_DLL environment variable as szlibdll.lib.

      Notes:

         a. When setting environment variables, only include path for
            the zlib DLL library, as the zlib static and DLL libraries
            share the same name --  zlib.lib.  For all other
            environment variables, you MUST NOT include the path.
            Otherwise, some of HDF5 tools tests will get unexpected
            results.

         b. If the zlib DLL library path is not C:\zlib114\dll, replace
            it with the correct path in the HDF5_EXT_ZLIB_DLL
            environment variable.

         c. You might have to close and reopen running programs for
            the new environment variable settings to take effect. 

         d. By default, c:\zlib114\dll\zlib.dll and 
            c:\szlib\dll\szibdll.dll should be copied into the location
            that the application can find, one suggestion is to use the 
            C:\WINNT\system or C:\WINDOWS\system directory before
            using DLLs.
      
   6. Set up path for external libraries and headers
    
      Skip this part if you don't want to use any compression features
      provided by HDF5.  Please do read section V.

      You have to read this part is you want to only use gzip or szip.
      You also need to read section V.

      Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ and go to "Tools" and select
      "Options", find "Directories";
      
      6.1 Find the box "Show directories for", choose 
          "Include files",
          If you cannot find your zlib and szlib header path
          (for example, C:\zlib114\include, C:\szlib\include)
          from the directory list, add the header path
          (C:\zlib114\include, C:\szlib\include) to the 
          included directories.
      
      6.2 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",
          If you cannot find your zlib and szlib library path
          (for example, C:\zlib114\lib, C:\szlib\lib, C:\szlib\dll)
          from the directory list, add the library path
          (C:\zlib114\lib, C:\szlib\lib, C:\szlib\dll) to the
          library directories.
      
      Similarly, you should set up these external libraries and
      headers paths for DEC Visual Fortran if you use it to build
      HDF5 Fortran libraries.

************************************************************************


Section II: How to build and test HDF5 libraries and tools 
========================================================================
STEP 1: Building HDF5 libraries and tools
    
   1. Unpack all.zip
    
      Unpack all.zip in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows directory.  Files in 
      all.zip has path hdf5\....  Make sure that you extract files into
      the C:\myHDFstuff directory. 

   2. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
    
      Invoke Microsoft Visual C++.  From the main menu, go to "File"
      and select the "Open Workspace" option. Then open the
      c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\proj\all\all.dsw workspace. 

      You should find windows project files listed as "all files, 
      big files etc." on the left.        

   3. (Optional) HDF5 C++, Fortran libraries and Intel compiler
    
      3.1 Skip this step if you do not want to build HDF5 C++ libraries
        
          Go to "Project" and select "dependencies";
          Select "all" in the "Select project to modify:" box,
          then enable the desired projects:
      
             dsets_cpp
             dsets_cppdll
             hdf5_cpp
             hdf5_cppdll
             testhdf5_cpp
             testhdf5_cppdll

      3.2 Skip this step if you do not want to build HDF5 Fortran
          libraries
        
          Go to "Project" and select "dependencies";
          Select "all" in the "Select project to modify:" box,
              
             flush1_fortran
             flush2_fortran
             hdf5_f90cstub
             hdf5_fortran
             libtest_fortran
             testhdf5_fortran
          
          Note: HDF5 Fortran DLL currently does not work with
                DEC Fortran 6.0 and Intel compiler.
          
      3.3 Skip this step if you are not using Intel compilers
    
          a. Intel C Compiler
             Go to Tools-->Select Compiler
             Check Intel box and click OK button.
          
          b. Intel Fortran Compiler
             Go to Tools-->Select Compiler
             Check Intel box and click OK button.
             Go to Tools-->Customize-->Add-ins and Macro Files
             and check Intel Fortran Compiler Build Tool
           
          Note: szip library is different when using Intel compiler.
                You should build szip source codes with Intel
                compiler or download binaries for Intel compiler
                from ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/szip/bin/windows.
                The szip library and header path should also be 
                set up accordingly (refer to precondition 6).
               
   4. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

      In "Project configurations", select the active configuration

	        "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of
	                single-threaded static libraries, Debug 
                        multithreaded DLLs and tests. 
                
                        or

	        "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
                        single-threaded static libraries, 
                        multithreaded DLLs and tests.

       Then build project "all".
       
       Warning messages can be ignored. 

       When the debug or release build is done the directories 
       listed below will contain the following files:

                                    library
       

STEP 2: Testing HDF5 libraries and tools

HDF5 libraries and tools should be tested to make sure that they were
built correctly.

We provide 2 options for users to test HDF5 libraries and tools.  

   Option 1: Automatic testings

   HDF5 comes with various test suites, all of which can be tested
   with hdf5check.bat batch file in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.

   hdf5check batch file can be run with the following four options:
   
      hdf5check                  test HDF5 C library and tools only
      
      hdf5check enablecpp        test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools
                                 To use this option, HDF5 C++ 
                                 libraries must have been built 
                                 in step I.
      
      hdf5check enablefortran    test HDF5 C/FORTRAN libraries and
                                 tools
                                 To use this option, HDF5 Fortran
                                 libraries must have been built 
                                 in step I.      
      
      hdf5check enableall        test HDF5 C/C++/FORTRAN libraries
                                 and tools
                                 To use this option, HDF5 C++ and 
                                 Fortran libraries must have been
                                 built in step I.      

   Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate
   options.

   Test results are saved in two files:

      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt   

      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt.

   In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If all the
   tests passed, then you do not have to check check_results.txt.  
   If some tests failed, check check_results.txt can help you
   figure out what was wrong.

   Option 2: Step-by-step HDF5 libraries and tools testings

   You can also test HDF5 libraries and tools one by one.  There are
   possibly four versions of HDF5 libraries and tools testings. 

   They are:

	 release version
	 release dll version
	 debug version
	 debug dll version

   We strongly suggest you to redirect your testing results into an
   output file so that you can easily check the testing results. You
   may use either Notepad or WordPad or whatever other windows word
   processor to check the results.  For the purpose of printing,  
   please choose font less than 14 for better alignment of the text.

   DLLs listed below should be placed into the Windows system
   directory.  A batch file named install_dll.bat is included in 
   c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.  Run this batch file and the 
   following HDF5 DLLs will be copied to the system directory.

      hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\Release\hdf5dll.dll
      hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\debug\hdf5ddll.dll
      hdf5\test\libtestD\release\libtestD.dll
      hdf5\test\libtestD\debug\libtestDd.dll

   1. HDF5 library testing 

      cd into the hdf5\test directory. 

         (1) basic tests
            
             Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

             a) release static version
             type:             
                hdf5test release >"Your output filename" 

             b) release dll version

             c) debug static version
             type: 
                hdf5timingtest debug >"Your output filename"

             d) debug dll version
             type:
                hdf5timingtest debug dll >"Your output filename"


      Use Notepad or WordPad to check results. You should 
      not find any FAILED marks in your output files.

   2. HDF5 tools testing
 
      To test HDF5 tools, cd back into hdf5 directory and then cd into 
      tools directory(c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tools).  The HDF5 tools testing
      results are saved into output files in tools directory by the
      testhdf5tools.bat as described below.

      Go to a) b) c) or d) to test your chosen version

         a) release static version
         type:             
            testhdf5tools release
         output file: toolstest_release.txt 

         b) release dll version
         type:
            testhdf5tools release dll
         output file: toolstest_releasedll.txt 
				
         c) debug static version
         type: 
            testhdf5tools debug
         output file: toolstest_debug.txt 

         d) debug dll version
         type:
            testhdf5tools debug dll
         output file: toolstest_debugdll.txt 
               
      Use Notepad or WordPad to check results. You should 
      not find any FAILED marks in your output files.
    
   3. HDF5 C++ library test
  
      Skip this step UNLESS you have built HDF5 C++ libraries
      and want to test them.
     
      DLLs listed below should be placed into to the Windows system
      directory.  A batch file named install_cppdll.bat is included in 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.  Run this batch file and the 
      following HDF5 C++ DLLs will be copied to the system directory.
       
         hdf5\proj\hdf5_cppdll\release\hdf5_cppdll.dll
         hdf5\proj\hdf5_cppdll\debug\hdf5_cppddll.dll

      Run hdf5cpptest.bat in the hdf5\c++\test directory at the 
      command prompt as below:
     
         hdf5cpptest release >"Your output filename"
         hdf5cpptest release dll >"Your output filename"
         hdf5cpptest debug >"Your output filename"
         hdf5cpptest debug dll >"Your output filename"

      Use Notepad or WordPad to check results. You should 
      not find any FAILED marks in your output files.
     
     
   4. HDF5 Fortran library test
  
      Skip this step UNLESS you have built HDF5 Fortran libraries     
      and want to test them.

      Run testhdf5_fortran.bat at the command prompt as below:

         testhdf5_fortran release >"Your output filename"
         testhdf5_fortran debug >"Your output filename"

      Use Notepad or WordPad to check results. You should 
      not find any FAILED marks in your output files.
     
      Note: Now we only support Fortran static libraries.


STEP 3: Installing HDF5 Libraries

We provide a batch file for users to relocate all HDF5 libraries in one
folder (C++ and Fortran libraries will also be copied into this folder
if they have been built in step 1).  The file is called
installhdf5lib.bat under c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.  Run the batch 
file, you may see a folder called hdf5lib under C:\myHDFstuff\hdf5.  
    
The <release> layout of <hdf5lib> should be:
    
   release\include   --  HDF5 header files
   release\bin       --  HDF5 static tool executables
   release\bindll    --  HDF5 DLL tool executables
   release\lib       --  HDF5 static libraries
   release\dll       --  HDF5 DLLs
       
You may also find the similar layout for the <debug>.


STEP 4: Building the C examples (Optional)

   1. Invoke Microsoft Visual C++, go to "File" and select
      the "Open Workspace" option. 
      Then open the workspace
      c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\allexamples\allexamples.dsw.

   2. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".

      In "Project configurations", select the active configuration

	 "allexamples -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of the
                                      examples.

             or
	
	 "allexamples -- Win32 Release" to build release versions the 
                                        examples.

      When the debug build or release build is done, there should be the 
      following subdirectories in C:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\examples\

          attributetest
 
          chunkread

          compoundtest 

          extendwritetest 

          grouptest 

          readtest 

          selecttest 

          writetest 

   3. Invoke a command prompt window and run the batch file 
      "InstallExamples.bat" which resides in the top level directory
      (C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5).  This file creates 2 new directories, 
      examplesREL and examplesDBG, in the C:\MyHDFstuff\examples
      directory and places all the executables in it.  Both the
      release and debug versions of the examples should be built 
      before this step is done.

   4. We provide a batch file named testExamples.bat and an expected
      examples tests output file named testExamples_exp_output.txt
      in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\examples directory for you to test the
      examples.
      
      testExamples.bat batch file has two options:

         testExamples release -- test release version of the examples

         testExamples debug   -- test debug version of the examples

      Invoke a command prompt window and run testExamples with
      appropriate options.  You should get "All HDF5 C examples tests
      passed." when the C examples are built successfully.  Otherwise,
      the difference between the expected outputs and actual outputs
      will be given.

************************************************************************


Section III: Building an application using the HDF5 library or DLL
========================================================================

If you are building an application that uses the HDF5 library the
following locations will need to be specified for locating header files
and linking in the HDF libraries:

   <top-level HDF5 directory>\src

where <top-level HDF5 directory> may be 

   C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\

We assume that you will use gzip and szip compression with HDF5 library.

To specify this location in the settings for your VC++ project, you may
choose one of the following two methods.

   1) 
    To insert the path that specifics HDF5 and zlib, szlib header files:

    1. Open your VC project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it is
       the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the 'Settings' option.

    3. Chose the build configuration you would like to modify in the
       drop down menu labeled with 'Settings For:'

    4. Chose the C/C++ tab

    5. At the bottom of the window, there should be a text-area labeled
       with 'Project Options:'. In this text-area, scroll until you
       reach the end and type /I "<top-level HDF5 directory>\src" and
       then click OK.

   
    To link the HDF5 library with your application:

    1. Open your VC project in Microsoft Visual C++ and make sure it is
       the active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the 'Add to Project' option and
       then 'Files' option.

    3. Change the 'Files of type:' to 'Library Files (.lib)'

    4. Navigate through the directories until you find the location of 
       the hdf5.lib. 

    5. Select hdf5.lib and click OK.

    6. repeat 1-5, to select zlib.lib and szlib.lib.

   2)
    Go to tools/options/directories,

    1. Insert the correct HDF5,zlib,szlib paths for both headers(include)
       and libraries.
    2. Go to the Project menu and choose the 'Settings' option.
    3. Find the "link" option and "Input" category, insert 
       "zlib.lib, szlib.lib, hdf5.lib".

To use the DLL:

    1. Follow the steps for specifying the location of the header files
       as shown above.

    2. Follow the steps for linking the HDF5 library as shown above
       except now link the export library that is created with the DLL.
       The export library is called hdf5dll.lib or hdf5ddll.lib for
       debug version.

    3. Place the DLL in a location that Windows will be able to locate 
       it. The searched path and order for DLL's is

       a) The directory where the executable module for the current
          process is located.
       b) The current directory. 
       c} The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory function 
          retrieves the path of this directory. 
       d) The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function
          retrieves the path of this directory.
       e) The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
 
    4. To modify your own application settings, please DO FOLLOW the 
       "DLL Hints" at section IV "HELPFUL POINTERS".

************************************************************************


Section IV: HELPFUL POINTERS
========================================================================

Here are some notes that may be of help if you are not familiar with
using the Visual C++ Development Environment.

Project name and location issues: 
       
    If you must install all.dsw and all.dsp in another directory,
    relative to hdf5 directory, you will be asked to locate the 
    sub-project files, when you open the project all.dsw.

    If you want to rename all (the entire project), you will need to
    modify two files all.dsw and all.dsp as text (contrary to the
    explicit warnings in the files).

    You can also modify all.dsw and all.dsp as text, to allow these 2
    files to be installed in another directory.

  
Settings... details:

    If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be read
    from the all.dsp file(as text), or from the Project Settings in the
    Developer Studio project settings dialog.

    Project
       Settings
	        C/C++
	           Category
	              PreProcessor
	                 Code Generation
	                    Use run-time Library
	                       These are all set to use Single-Threaded

DLL... hints:
  
   If you want to use DLL versions of HDF5 library in your application, 
   you should  
      1) put HDF5 DLL into windows system directory
      2) add HDF5 DLL export library into your project
      3) Follow "Settings... details" into the last line:
         change Single-Threaded into Multithreaded DLL or 
         Debug Multithreaded DLL
      4) Follow "Settings.. details" into PreProcessor:
         Project
            Settings
               C/C++
                  Category
                     PreProcessor

         Find PreProcessor definations and Add _HDF5USEDLL_ at the
         end of the PreProcessor definitions.

Section V: How to disable gzip(zlib)/szip compression

Warning: When you modify the H5pubconf.h file as described below,
         DO NOT just change the values of these macros from 1 to 0.
         Please DO remove(or comment out) appropriate lines.
         
   1. Disable gzip compression 

      If you would like to remove gzip compression from the HDF5
      library, follow the steps below.

      1.1 Open the H5pubconf.h file from the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\src
          directory and remove(or comment out) the following two lines:

             #define H5_HAVE_ZLIB_H 1
             #define H5_HAVE_FILTER_DEFLATE 1

          then save the file.
	  
      1.2 Delete HDF5_EXT_ZLIB environment variable if you have
          set it in preconditions.
   
      1.3 Delete HDF5_EXT_ZLIB_DLL environment variable if you have
          set it in preconditions.
   
      1.4 Run-compile HDF5 library according to section II.

      When you disable gzip, you may get the following message
      when building HDF5 libraries:

      The following environment variables were not found
      $(HDF5_EXT_ZLIB)
      $(HDF5_EXT_ZLIB_DLL)

      This message can be ignored.

   2. Disable szip compression (both encoder and decoder)

      If you would like to remove szip compression from the HDF5
      library, follow the steps below.

      2.1 Open the H5pubconf.h file from the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\src
          directory and remove(or comment out) the following three
          lines: 

             #define H5_HAVE_SZLIB_H 1
             #define H5_HAVE_FILTER_SZIP 1
             #define H5_SZIP_CAN_ENCODE 1
		   
          then save the file.
	
      2.2 Delete HDF5_EXT_SZIP environment variable if you have
          set it in preconditions.
   
      2.3 Delete HDF5_EXT_SZIP_DLL environment variable if you have
          set it in preconditions. 
   
      2.4 Run-compile HDF5 library according to section II.

      When you disable szip, you may get the following message 
      when building HDF5 libraries:

      The following environment variables were not found
      $(HDF5_EXT_SZIP)
      $(HDF5_EXT_SZIP_DLL)

      This message can be ignored.

   Note:   

   To disable gzip and szip at the same time, just following 1.1~1.3
   and 2.1~2.3 and run-compile HDF5 library according to section II.

   3. Disable szip encoder

      If you would like to just disable szip encoder from the HDF5
      library while keeping szip decoder enabled, follow the steps
      below.

      3.1 Download szip library without encoder

          szip library is different if you want to disable szip encoder.
          Download szip_noencoder binaries from
          ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/szip/bin/windows.
          The szip library and header path should also be set up
          accordingly (refer to precondition 6).
   
      3.2 Open the H5pubconf.h file from the src directory and remove
          (or comment out) the following line: 

             #define H5_SZIP_CAN_ENCODE 1
		   
          then save the file.
	
      3.3 Delete HDF5_SZIP_ENCODE environment variable if you have
          set it in preconditions.

      3.4 Run-compile HDF5 library according to section II.

************************************************************************


Section VI: How to build HDF5 in VS 7.0(.NET)    
========================================================================

We just briefly introduce you how to build HDF5 in VS 7.0(.NET);

1. Open the old workspace file with the "Open solution" option,
   .NET will automatically convert the data space file to solution file.
2. Then find  "Build" and go to "Configuration Manager"; choose
   "release" or "debug", then choose "build all".
3. If you want to change some project setting, select the project and
   right click the button to choose Properties; find the similar menu
   there as in 6.0.
4. You need to specify the zlib and szip include header files and 
   libraries under Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories and choose
   Include and libraries under the category of "show directories for" to
   add the corresponding path if you want to use compression feature
   inside HDF5.

NOTE: Please read section V if you do not want to use compression
      feature inside HDF5.
 
************************************************************************


Section VII: Building and testing HDF5 snapshot release
========================================================================

Note: This section is only for users who would like to build and test 
      HDF5 snapshot release.

If you want to test and build HDF5 snapshot release, you need extra 
steps to automatically generate H5Tinit.c before going to section II
step 1(2).

Previous step: section II, step 1(1).
Extra steps:
1) After extracting all.zip to the correct path, open the 
   c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\misc\typegen\typegen.dsw.
2) Build the project file.
3) Invoke command prompt and go to c:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\src.
4) type H5Tinit.exe >H5Tinit.c
5) Go back to section II, continue with step 1(2).

************************************************************************


Section VIII: Misc.
========================================================================

1) drivers we support
The default driver on windows we support is sec2 driver. However, stdio
driver is also supported. If you want to use stdio driver in your 
application, you may set environment variable HDF5_DRIVER to "stdio".

On windows 2000/XP, the following steps should be followed to set the
environment variable,

 a) Go to Control panel and find "system",
 b) Click "system" and choose "advanced",
 c) Choose Environment Variables
 d) Add new variable "HDF5_DRIVER"
 e) set the "HDF5_DRIVER" to "stdio"

Reminder: if you don't want to use stdio driver, please remember to 
delete the environment variable "HDF5_DRIVER" or change the variable 
value to "sec2".


Please send email to hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu for further assistance.
