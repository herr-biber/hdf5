     HDF5 Fortran90 Library Build and Testing Instructions for Windows NNT/2000
     with DEC Visual Fortran V6.0
===============================================================================


Preconditions

    1. These instructions are for users who wish to build the C and 
       Fortran90 libraries.  If you are interested only in the C library, 
       see INSTAll_Windows.txt or INSTAll_codewarrior.txt.

    2. MS VC++ V 6.0, DEC Visual Fortran V6.0, and WinZip must be installed
       prior to building the HDF5 library.


    3. Download the hdf5-1.4.5 distribution archive and run WinZip to unpack 
       the source code.  The code will be unpacked into the hdf5\ directory.

    4. GNU zlib library should be installed on the machine. 


Building the HDF5 Fortran and C libraries 

    1. Unpack all_withf90.zip, found in the hdf5\ directory, into the 
       hdf5\ directory.

    2. Go to the hdf5\proj\ directory and click on the file all.dsw. 
       This will invoke MS VC++.
     
    3. Select "Build", then select "Set Active Configuration".

            "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of
                single-threaded static libraries, debug multithreaded DLLs,

                and tests. 

            "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
                single-threaded static libraries, multithreaded DLLs,
                and tests.

    When the debug or release build is completed, the directories 
    listed below will contain the following files:

           hdf5\proj\hdf5\debug - 
           hdf5\proj\hdf5\release - 
               hdf5.lib- the F90 and C hdf5 libraries

           hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\debug - 
               hdf5ddll.dll- the F90 and C hdf5 libraries
               hdf5ddll.lib- the dll export library                  

           hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\release - 
               hdf5dll.dll- the F90 and C hdf5 libraries
               hdf5dll.lib- the dll export library

Testing libraries and tools

    1. See the file INSTALL_Windows.txt (STEP 2) for how for instruction on 
       testing the C HDF5 library and tools.

    2. To test Fortran HDF5 Library, run testhdf5_fortran.bat in the
       hdf5\fortran\test directory
